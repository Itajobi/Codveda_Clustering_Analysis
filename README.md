# Clustering Analysis(K-Means)
This task focuses on implementing K-Means clustering to group similar data points based on feature similarity using customer usage metrics.

## Objective

Standardize numerical features

Identify the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method

Apply K-Means clustering

Visualize clusters in 2D space

## Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas

scikit-learn (StandardScaler, KMeans, PCA)

matplotlib, seaborn

## Methodology

Selected usage and charge-related features

Standardized data using StandardScaler

Determined optimal clusters via the Elbow Method

Applied K-Means (k = 3)

Reduced dimensionality using PCA for visualization

## Visualization

Elbow curve to select optimal number of clusters

2D scatter plot showing customer segments after PCA transformation

## Outcome

Successfully grouped customers into three distinct clusters

Identified usage patterns and similarities among customer groups
